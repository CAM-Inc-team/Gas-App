Hi Iâ€™m Austin. I'm currently in my last semester at WCC and planning to transfer to a university to pursue a bachelor's degree. Before returning to school last year, I pursued two different career paths: hairstylist and flight attendant. Working in these customer-facing positions taught me skills like patience, empathy, and leadership. I enjoy spending my time playing cozy-games and traveling when I have the opportunity.
